App that lets you see when trains will arrive.

Our target audience are people who may not have alot of time to prepare meals, people who need ideas for meal planning and people who need instruction on making meals. The app allows users to search for a meal name, a food i.e "Chicken", and the the app will display 10 recipes related to the search. Each should take 30 min or less to cook.
